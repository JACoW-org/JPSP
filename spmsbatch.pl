# the script "spmsbatch.pl"
# 0) needs the following packages
#
#    Data::Dumper  just for debug purposes (can be commented out)
#
# 1) reads a file named according to the config file "conference_xmlfile"
#    which contains a list of conference papers with conforming xml tagging
#    like the following example
#!-
#!- deleted .... xml structures changed too much
#!-
# 2) produces from above list a number of TeX-files (">papercode<.tex"),
#    which can be processed by pdfTeX to generate new pdf-files from
#    the old, but containing information about "Title", "Author(s)",
#    and "Keywords", the "Subject" field receives the "Conference name",
#    because there are no other known information to be placed. In addition
#    header and footer information are printed on each page:
#    - header/centered  "name of conference"
#    - footer/out       "page number from proceedings volume"
#    - footer/center    "paper code"
#    - footer/in        "group of paper (invited/contributed/poster/...)"
# 3) produces a Win batch file
#    - "gen_texpdf.bat" to generate all "final" pdf-files

#                                         into flushleft)
#    v2.0  10. Apr 2004  volker rw schaa  adaption to matt's xml structure
#    v2.1  22. Apr 2004  volker rw schaa  nearly full adaption to matt's xml,
#                                         start of documentation, beautifying script after wild changes...
#    v2.2  29. Apr 2004  volker rw schaa  second stage of docu,
#                                         abstracts now internal instead of external,
#                                         script runs with Matt's test set (after some remedies: one line <keyword>-entries,
#                                         supplying missing fields, etc.)
#    v3.0  06. Jun 2004  volker rw schaa  restart with very old version after disk crash, backup from old notebook not usable (???!),
#                                         files on new notebook weren't synchronized due to harddisk swap after initial tests,
#                                         status: loss of all adapted scripts
#                                         history: retyped from printed version's first and only page :-(
#    v3.1  10. Jun 2004  vrws             everything adapted, docu missing, scripts ugly, this is not a distributable version!!
#                                         authors are listed one per line in all displays (no combined entry per institute,
#                                         tags <footnote> and <agency> are not honored
#    v3.2  20. Jul 2004  vrws             extending the script for abstract booklet production with ConTeXt
#    v3.3  30. Aug 2004  vrws             change of hard-coded style info into style sheet for author/paper title, etc.
#    v3.8  24. Sep 2004  vrws             changed for CD production all file names to UPPERCASE
#    v3.9   4. Okt 2004  vrws             bugs fixed from introduction of UPPERCASE file names
#    v3.91 11. Okt 2004  vrws             all talks (the ones with a video = coupling) got transparencies to patch for missing files (#ä)
#    v3.92 13. Okt 2004  vrws             affiliation (contrib_abb/presenter_abb) is now composed of
#                                            a) Affiliation + Town, if "Affiliation_abbrev" exists, or
#                                            b) Affiliation.Name1 + Affiliation.Name2 + Town, if no "Affiliation_abbrev" is given
#    v3.93 17. Nov 2004  vrws             keyword generation (search) from pdf files now in script "scan-keywords.pl"
#                                            - output file will be read to get keywords ($raw_paper_directory/keyword-count.txt)
#                                            - keyword generation from abstract text commented out (edit key: #ßß)
#    v3.94 -- v4.03                       lost
#    v4.04 10. Oct 2005  vrws             classification/subclassification
#                                            - PAC conferences have a different way of using class/subclass: a classification may
#                                              not have a subclass, or may have entries under the classification and subclassification.
#                                              This should be fixed now!
#    v4.05 19. Oct 2005  vrws             - checking whether a slides file (<file_type abbrev="TRAN">Transparencies</file_type>)
#                                           mentioned in XML is really there. A slides entry will only be written, when a file
#                                           entry exists in $slides_directory
#    v4.06 24. Oct 2005  vrws             - this version finally includes the (not so)special last name translation routine,
#                                           which was already used in v 3.98/9, but somehow discarded. The translation
#                                           to ISO-Latin 1 is surely not an good idea, we should decide on UTF-8!
#    v4.07 09. Nov 2005  vrws             - a bit more ISO 9660 in the scripts :-)
#                                           all files now with .HTM
#                                         - clean-up of unused code
#    v4.08     Nov 2005  vrws             - some new UTF-8 code fragments added to translation table which are produced when
#                                           file is stored directly (xml save, without cut/paste to file or wget)
#    v4.09 10. Jan 2006  vrws             - lead/trailing spaces in all <xname> tags deleted
#                                         - all code and comments deleted for keyword generation (now scan-keyword.pl)
#    v4.10 11. Jan 2006  vrws             - more lead/trailing spaces in tags deleted,
#                                         - sub classification string is now initialized (to " ") when classification is read
#                                         - now a local default startup file "INDEXLOC.HTM" is created
#    v4.11 14. Feb 2006  vrws             - Version 4.10 brought a new error by initialized sub classification string to " ", the
#                                           test still was on =""!!
#                                         - id for @ (&#64) changed to (&#65131)
#    v4.12 29. Apr 2006  vrws             - Reintroduction of provisions for page count checking
#                                           (output file "pages_per_paper.txt")
#                                         - the new version of SPMS has a new tag structure "<coordinators>...</coordinators>"
#                                           which contains an inconsistent use of the <institute> tag structure. The
#                                           <coordinators>-code is skipped in reading
#    v4.13 17. May 2006  vrws             - error corrected in transparency detection (uppercase/lowercase ".pdf")
#                                         - output of xml lines in debug log with "||"
#                                         - clean-up of config file (all unused variables deleted)
#                                         - clean-up of debug lines
#    v5.0  22. May 2006  vrws             - now optimized pdfs (Fast Web View) will be produced by gen_texpdf.bat
#    v5.1  28. May 2006  vrws             - some more variables initialized, so the number of error lines when processing non
#                                           finalized xml files has been drastically reduced
#                                         - in early stages of a conference 'New Affiliation Request Pending' might cause lots of
#                                           error messages which are now reported
#                                         - substitution of "$" and "%" were not line global but local, fixed now
#    v5.2  12. Jun 2006  vrws             - in an early stage of a conference, "paper_code"s are not present in the XML file
#                                           while "abstract_id"s are. Code revised so that first "abstract_id" is taken for $paper
#                                           in the next stage "paper_code" overwrites this setting, if present. Now test output
#                                           can be generated without "paper_code" setting
#                                         - the XML file is now opened as assumed UTF-8 input. So now the 2 and 3 byte UTF-8 codes
#                                           (hopefully) are converted to the correct glyphs (still in test)
#    v5.3  17. Jun 2006  vrws             - opening the XML as UTF-8 helps in cases (FEL'06) but generates lots of errors in
#                                           others (FLS'06); in addition the code is much slower using the utf-8 option:
#                                           (0:10m compared to 2:07m for FEL'06). Now back to pre-version v5.2, code must be
#                                           changed to handle more utf-8 2 byte and 3 byte sequences
#    v5.4  25. Jun 2006  vrws             - Matt has repaired the "<coordinators>...</coordinators>" tag structure, so now
#                                           everything is read again
#    v5.5  12. Jul 2006  vrws             - fixing error in xml when chair has no email (error in generated XML)
#                                         - fixed problem with ConTeXt output not being converted to TeX chars (some instances
#                                           of author names and title lines escaped my notice)
#                                         - changed substitution of "&amp;" to "\&"
#                                         - title entries in KEYW*.HTM and AUTH*.HTM extended to contain actual keyword and
#                                           author. For KEYW*.HTM the actual keyword is added to the meta data "keywords" too.
#                                           This is not directly visible on the web due to the framed setting, but indexing
#                                           robots (Google, etc) which link them directly can show infos now.
#                                         - GPL license added
#    v5.6  26. Jul 2006  vrws             - email address field initialized (we really do not need the email address
#                                           for anything useful - and in PNP12 there is no email at all)
#                                         - more initializations: $session_startp/session_endp for sessions without papers (FEL2006)
#                                         - problems with "e-" substitution when something like "one- or two-fold" comes up,
#                                           now corrected
#                                         - recognition of writing exponentiations (e9/10**9/10-9/etc) improved
#    v5.7  29. Jul 2006  vrws             - list environment formatting doesn't really work the way as intended, formatting fixed now
#                                         - special symbols or LaTeX notations with $....$ are hard to convert, so if the $s
#                                           (dolares) come in pairs they will be deleted otherwise we have to deal with them directly...
#                                         - special LaTeX commands converted to ConTeXt for Abstract booklet processing
#    v5.8  14. Aug 2006  vrws             - pdfopt 'destroys' some of the pdf files (error 110). The code is commented out now
#                                         - addition of special symbols or LaTeX notations (Ohm, cm^+-x, \bf{xx})
#                                         - conversion of 10xx to power corrected (some zip codes appeared in power notation)
#                                         - output of elapsed time to ease run-time measurements
#    v5.9  16. Aug 2006  vrws             - when there is no PDF file present in $paper_directory (./PAPERS) no link will be
#                                           generated anymore from "Authors list", "Session list", and "Classification list",
#                                           Instead the <papercode> is given without link and a non-breakable (&nbsp;) space is
#                                           output instead of the page number. This is due to conferences where either no
#                                           papers will be uploaded (PNP12@GSI), or for workshops with only transparencies
#                                           shown (FLS2006@DESY)
#                                         - initialization error corrected in when writing 'SCRTYPE' with document types other
#                                           then 'DOC' or 'TeX' (in this case Open Office 'ODT')
#    v5.10 26. Aug 2006  vrws             - number of papers per line per author in TeX and ConTeXt output corrected
#                                           (error: first line one, next lines wanted number of papers, due to wrong initialization)
#                                         - listed page numbers as long as there are no <toc> values changed from "0" to "1"
#                                         - list formatting ([+ ... +]) has been extended to [+ -) text +] for unordered lists
#    v5.11 21. Sep 2006  vrws             - BESSY enhancements: sound (MP3) files for talks now with link in web pages
#                                           (thanks to Roland Müller!)
#                                         - script adapted to Acrobat 7's way of writing Media- and Crop-Boxes
#                                         - code for 'itemize lists' produced a wrong list if text contained closing braces "x)"
#                                           without preceeding space character
#                                         - 'Missing Papers' are now generated directly in the way as needed for LINAC04 and DIPAC03/05:
#                                           whole page with title, authors, institutes, and abstract (column one) and 'Missing Note'

#                                         - detected that since the TOC values are generating by SPMS, only non-numbered session sheets are
#                                           supported (whether this is a standard in book printing is open)
#                                         - \cleardoublepage reintroduced for non-numbered session sheets (otherwise the whole counting
#                                           is completely off)

#                                           local link (href="KEYW1.HTM#"/"AUTH1.HTM#"). So 50 byte per keyword and 47 per author saved.
#                                         - complete code of sub "inclsession_in_proctex" removed (see editmark #070109) due to page offset

#    v6.4   2. Mar 2007  vrws             - $santitle globally used because sanitizing the title isn't enough, it's also needed for

#                                           in the list of papers for an author. This fixed the author index.

#                                           author/affiliation has to be reduced to one appearance per acronym: how so => different acronyms for different institutes or

#   v19.6   20. Jul 2014 vrws             - MD5 hash for utf8_name entries is now based on last name + first name-initials minus all characters 
#											outside ".", "-", "a-zA-Z" group
#                                         - the problems with lowercasing Ö have been treated by hardwiring "Ö"ztürk in procedure "helpsort_acc_chars"
#                                         - added comment "#140724" for all appearances of "$paper_struc" which was indented to detect needed structures of one and the 
#                                           same paper but had never been reset to false

#                                         - all paper_code lines now have an anchor id (id="paper_code") 
#                                         - on secondary entries (MPC) the primary code is shown (text: use link for more material under primary paper code)
#                                         - secondary entries in MPC without PDFs will show hover-text "Check primary paper code for contribution" 
#                                         - secondary paper codes are shown with their primary entry (text: link to different session where

#                                         - secondary paper codes are skipped in "Authors Index" main build, but are added as alternate paper_codes under main entry

#                                           now for each Talk_PDF a command is written (using "exiftool") which sets "Author", "Creator", "Subject" and "Title" of the file.
#											The same is true for Poster_PDFs, but as only the main author is mentioned, it is subject to revision
#   v22.1   17. May 2015 vrws             - Matt's new page correction procedure in SPMS "editor.set_page_count" is functioning and can now be used, 
#                                           to ease the job of "page_check.pl", all parameters needed for writing a batch file are now communicated via

#   v22.2   22. May 2015 vrws             - INSPIRE records for authors with several affiliations are now combined into one $100/$700 record:
#                                           Annette: Wir verwenden das $$u Feld mehrfach, für jeden Autor nur ein 100/700Feld, aber mit mehrfachen affiliations.
#											subroutines "INSPIRE_write_data_record" for combined author records and "INSPIRE_Keywords" for keyword records
#										  - small clean-up	
#                                         - all two-argument "open" statements changed to three arguments (perl:critic)

#                                         - vertical offset in Author, Participant and Institute list corrected
#                                         => to be checked, probably not true anymore => - procedure "CopyrightOffset" now called before list generation 
#                                            (Author, Institute, Participants) using the last know page count
#										  - new problem spotted: the institutes list collects authors only to the first lastname+initial agreement 
#                                           (R. Mueller/H. Shang) appears with wrong institute (HZB instead of GSI/ANL instead of INEST) 
#                                           => solved by introducing the JACoW Author Id for comparision. 
#                                         o Has to be checked: is $aaid[] the same sort order as $sorted_auth_id[]?
#                                         - obviously the multicols environment moves the footer lines up by 11pt, this has been compensated by linefeed entries in the 
#                                           list generation of Authors, Institutes and Participants 
#                                         - data format TXT for citations modified: "~" between initials and lastname changed to " "; always write out the full name
#                                           string (no: "et al."); "\url{}" removed
#   v22.4a   10. Aug 2015 vrws            - a number of missing escapes in regular expressions for LaTeX command brackets {} added
#   v22.4b   22. Aug 2015 vrws            - if a name contains an html-entity, the reg-exp screwed up the original string, fixed now. 
#											Problem still open: html entity character
#                                           as first character for sorting is not re-instituted and therefore doesn't show in print-out or web page
#   v23.0    28. Sep 2015 vrws            - corrections done when testing with Todd for MacOS
#                                           o error message for missing "names-utf.txt" was wrongly concatenated showing "." after the directory name
#                                           o OS_platform is detect inside all scripts (therefore removed from config file)
#   v23.1    11. Jan 2016 vrws            - JACoW.org => accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf in INSPIRE records
#                                         - ^{&}#xxxx; error
#                                         - substitute ^{-1} and ^{-} in INSPIRE records
#                                         - additional escaped braces due to error message "Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated, passed through in regex"
#                                         - button 'Home' in "b0nner.htm" changed from "../index.htm" to "../index.html"
#   v23.2    04. Feb 2016 vrws            - new definitions for citations (JACoW template 201602xx) 
#            30. Jan 2016 vrws            - script needs now a DOI directory for the generation of DOI XML metadata files and mds-suite records
#   v24.0    24. Feb 2016 vrws			  - DOI data set entered into INSPIRE record. Format information by mail from Kirsten Sachs
#                                         - more additions for DOI handling
#                                         - conference_url now points to the real URL where the conference proceedings appear,
#											e.g. "https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/IPAC2016"
#   v24.1    28. Feb 2016 vrws            - several new config specifiers introduced 
#                                           o DOI_prefix: either 10.5072 (test domain) or 10.18429 (real JACoW DOIs)
#											o DOI_site  : https://jacow.org/DOI/<conference_name>/ is site of DOI landing page
#														  (which points to https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/DOI/)
#											o data_generation_date: signifies the date when the data were originally available
#                                         - DOI landing page design/realization 
#                                         - generation of MDS records for registering the DOIs with DataCite (doesn't work...)
#                                         - generation for registering the DOIs with DataCite now using curl records, as this works out of the box
#										  - ???
#   v24.2    01. Mar 2016 vrws            - changes to existing config variables:
#											o conference_editor is now a list of editors containing a JACoW or ORCID Id: 
#												Volker RW Schaa (GSI, Darmstadt, Germany)[ORCID:0000-0003-1866-8570]
#											  > is has to follow the affiliation and be placed inside [JACoW:xxxx] or [ORCID:0000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]
#											  > each editor has to be sperarated using a ";"
#										  - new directories for XML (DOI metadata) and HTML (DOI landing page) will be automatically created below the 
#											DOI directory if not existing
#                                         - 50% run time speed up ($doi_landing_str controls now data generation in first pass only - stupid error!)
#                                         - proceed1.tex now with pdf-fields filled (hypersetup), $introhyp removed as commands are included in both setups
#                                         - DOI_useraccount introduced to shortend account and password entry for each command
#                                         - finally html error "anchor occurs multiple times" in author html files corrected. 
#											The assumption that duplication of anchors only happens due to author appearance in consecutive papers was wrong.
#										  - error fixed for authors with two (or more) affiliation at the same institute (same acronym or none) and has already appeared
#											in the first institute file (opening/closing corrected on same author, works probably only on last author in the list)
#										  - test on IPAC2014 revealed problems on conferences using secondary paper codes. $DOI_land variables are determined 
#											for paper code wwhere PDF files but secondary papercodes have their PDF under primary code. Therefore hack to set 
#											$citdoi from primary code when $DOI_land{doi} undefined
#										  - file uploads for secondary codes are flagged as mismatching files. Now these messages are suppressed when the 
#											secondary code matches
#   v24.3    10. Mar 2016 vrws            - adding "Highwire Press tags" to DOI landing and citation export pages
#										  - BiBTeX export (re)added following examples from DESY/CERN/GSI (used latest additions made for biblatex: "venue")
#										  - citation export pages converted from TXT to HTML to not confuse web server settings (.ltx desaster) and to enable 
#											correct enocding (UTF8)
#										  - missing style for @unpublished added for BiBTeX, other citation exports adapted to deliver baic data for unpublished papers
#                                         - modifications to all citation styles
#											o BiBTeX @unpublished style for unpublished papers
#											o ccc
#											o
#   v24.4    16 Mar 2016 vrws             - started addon for Institutes Page (Authors + Papers/DOIs)
#            21 Mar 2016 vrws			  - Ronny detected that no message were given for not received submissions: 
#											string for "paper_not_received_text" was quoted and screwed up the HTML for the tooltip
#											(Error: Quote “"” in attribute name. Probable cause: Matching quote missing somewhere earlier.)

#            10 Apr 2016 vrws             - dangling </td> in instdoi files removed
#										  - map "Dot Operator" U+22C5 to "Middle Dot" U+00B7 / \cdot ["Dot Operator" is placed higher in most fonts, ...]
#										  - unknown character &#61624; U+F0B8 converted to "ndash" as it was used as a 'to sign' in "1&#61624;4.5 GeV/u".
#										  - &#9702; U+25E6 (White Bullet) used as degree sign
#            17 Apr 2016 vrws			  - fixed empty reference to DOI-landing page in case of Secondary paper code for Endnote-XML

#	v25.0	01 Jun 2016 vrws			  - built in support for LuaLaTeX version >0.85
#										  - the redirection from "jacow.org/<conference_name>" to "https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/<conference_name>" works now, 
#											but "<conference_name>" was defined to be lowercase
#										  - sanitize INSPIRE/DOI xml from html like <strong>
#										  - finally the video directory is needed as now a video file turned up at IPAC2016 (videos had been  external links before [EPAC'04])
#											code rewritten and adapted to the handling of talks/slides
#										  - code for export of bibliographic data for text (Word) changed to HTML with italics and curly apostrophes
#	v25.1	 04 Jul 2016 vrws			  - ATC generation run with LaTeX and doesn't understand the LuaLaTeX version >0.85 fix; introduced $introbase without this fix
#	v25.2	 03 Aug 2016 vrws			  - $introbase now used for "proceed.tex" and "proceed1.tex" as they are produced using pdfLaTeX

#											(mostly \xc2-combinations, but not all make sense)
#	v25.5	 23 Aug 2016 vrws			  - out of a sudden we have different XML tags depending on ???what??? (detected in SPMS v10.4.10)
#											MEDSI'16 has Poster session papers with <start_time> and <duration>, IBIC'16 only has <duration>, therefore many error messages
#											=> <start_time> and <duration> only checked for "Oral" now
#	v25.6	 10 Sep 2016 vrws			  - DOI reference has to go with data export flag (for Pre-Releases!!)
#	v25.7	 15 Sep 2016 vrws			  - merged branch topic #generate_index_basefile of version v24.0-exp into main.
#										  - merged branch topic #conference_longname of version v24.0-exp into main.
#   v25.8    09 Nov 2016 john poole/vrws - the abbreviated month for the publication picked up the wrong month due to wrong usage of substr 
#											(third argument is length not position)
#   v25.9        Dec 2016 vrws			  - improvements for directory structure: to be able to use the redirection from JACoW.org to CERN, the subdirs for
#											DOI metadata and html files have to follow the sequence of "<conference><doi>" and can't be a directory of its own.
#										  -	changes to the generation of bibliographic data and their presentation on the web page (/export): 
#											the BibTeX, LaTeX, Text/Word, RIS, EndNote (xml) so that the web page shows a 'code formatting' of the 
#											exported data file as text: e.g. MOXAA01-bib.html shows MOXAA01-bib.txt, which gets an additional download link.
#										  - config flags for "download_papers", "download_posters", "download_talks", download_sources", and "download_new_only" have
#											been removed as now all download batch files are generated by default.
#										  - editors must carry a unique id, either ORCID or JACoW [<id-origin:id>], to get the correct JACoWId, 
#											use https://oraweb.cern.ch/pls/jacow/xml2.author?ln=<lastname>&fn=<firstname> and search for "exact" match
#	v26.0        Jan 2017 vrws			  - new major release number as the directory structure is not compatible with the v24 configuration file anymore.
#											New (+), removed (-), prepared (~) or changed (o) configuration options:
#											- "conference_longname" is gone from the parameter list as it can be genrated from other parameters (_title, _site, _date)
#											~ "conference_pre"	signals whether it is a production run (=0) or a Pre-Release run (=1)
#											~ "conference_pre_text" carries the pre-release text to be embedded in the web pages and on each page of the papers
#												e.g. "- Pre-Release Snapshot 07-Oct-2016 18:00"
#											o "DOI_site" is only used when defined. It is now assumed that the standard directory of the proceedings will 
#												be used: http://jacow.org/<conference>/doi/ => http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/AccelConf/<conference>/doi/
#											o "doi_directory" is now the name of a single level subdirectory which is the DOI landing page (containing the DOI HTML files)
#											+ "doixml_directory" is the directory for XML and DOI registration batch files
#	v26.0a								  - modifications to the generation of Pre-releases: now the configuration option "conference_pre" flags whether it's a production
#											run or a pre-release (now the page numbers from the SPMS XML are ignored to be able to run a pre-release even when the
#											"Generate TOC values" procedure has already been applied -> like at MEDSI2016)
#	v26.0b								 => errors NOT fixed yet:
#											o unescaped "&" in exported references for EndNote (xml)
#											x (see v26.1) correct sort sequence for "ARing" in lastname as first letter
#											o wrong syntax in \high with LaTeX commands in brackets (e.g. $60\high{\}circ$ => 60\high{$\circ$})
#											o substitution of closing apostrophes not prevent wrong accent commands (e.g. " => "{}{} =>! "{} or doublequote)
#											o substitution of UTF8 sequences which let to the 'same' character (e.g. Â-- => -- ; Â'' => '' ; Â'  => ')
#	v26.0c								 => missing in this release is v25.9's change of bibliographic data as there are browser issues (depending on 
#											filetype of to embedded file)
#										 => the JSON code for bibliographic data is commented out as it was not linked to on the export page 
#											(Jan doesn't see a necessity for JSON)
#	v26.0d								 => the code for automatic concatenation of paper PDFs for Author/Title Check (ATC binders) has been removed 
#											from this version (additional tools to be tested as pdfTK doesn't belong actually to the list) 
#   v26.0d      Jan 2017 vrws			  - this version published
#										  - reformatting of editor id and documentation extended
#										  - corrections for the reencoding of U+0096 (en-dash) from v13.2: some cases were not covered as U+0096 appears 
#											in UTF8 as xC5 x96. Now added.
#   v26.0e      Feb 2017 vrws			  - all parts for a the conference pre-press handling implemented and tested
#   v26.1 	 04 Feb 2017 vrws			  - problem for invalid session links for secondary paper codes solved. Procedure "find_lc_session" now find the correct
#											session name when the papercodes are not consisting of session_abbr + sequence number, but have addition characteristics
#											as Invited/Contributed/etc. E.g. NA-PAC had session "WEA1" containing papers "WEA1IO01" or "WEA1CO04"
#										  - procedure "helpsort_acc_chars" changed: as in the current locale not all characters gets lowercased using "lc", now the
#											corresponding capital letters have been entered into the substitution list. This fixes the issue of v26.0b (correct sort
#											sequence for "ARing")
#             							  - new character translation of utf8 glyphs to LaTeX 
#                                           o Latin Capital Letter D with Stroke U+0110 => Ð
#											o Latin Small Letter E with Circumflex and Grave U+1EC1 => \`{\^{e}}
#											o Latin Small Letter E with Circumflex and Tilde U+1EC5 => \~{\^{e}}
#										  - now the generation of bibliographic export and DOI data is suppressed when pre-press is requested ("conference_pre" = 1)
#										  - bibliographic export for Text/Word had wrong zMonth/Year 
#   v26.2 	 24 Feb 2017 vrws			  - diagnostic output for not included PDF files in "proceed1.tex"
#										  - title in InstDOI was missing UTF_convert_spec_chars and UTF_supb

#											o \x{015f} => \c{s} Latin Small Letter S with Cedilla
#											o \x{017b} => \.{Z} Latin Capital Letter Z with Dot Above
#										  - encoding for the units "LXAF", "LXSP", and "LTXAidx" changed to explicit "encoding(iso-8859-1)"
#											to prevent wrong encoding issues when opening with LaTeX editors (an additional line is written 
#											to ensure this "% !TeX encoding = ISO-8859-1")
#										  - introduced missing "revert_from_context" on "LXAF"/"LXSP" for the session location 
#										  - "doi:" substituted by "https://doi.org/" due to
#												 https://www.crossref.org/blog/revised-crossref-doi-display-guidelines-are-now-active/
#            18 May 2017 vrws	          - changed placement of "Pre-Release" text from [CE, CO] to [RE, LO] so it doesn't bump into the papercode

#										  - the author string before version v29.1 was wrongly implemented as it contained the institute in "[...]". The institute string had commas
#											between acronym, city and country which led to wrong author names in the metadata as names are expected to be separated by commas
#										  - corrected: author string should have each name only once, due to the implementation with institute they appeared multiple times
#										  - modified the Copyright statement on the DOI landing page
#   v29.2	 13 Apr 2019 vrws			  - some corrections are done to "confproc.css" to achieve closer W3C validation
#										  - added missing ALT tag for Creative Commons CC logo on DOI page 
#										  - "type" attributes for style sheets (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript) removed as they are standard in HTML5
#										  - new diagnostic output for Initials which seem too long (> 6 chars)
#										  - tag "asynch" in <script> has not been applied as hyphenation (en.js) will stop
#										  - update to the landing page with removing part of the 'conference specific data' (Session (name, date), Main/Sub Classification, Keywords)
#										  - changes alignment for authors field on DOI landing page to "left"
#										  - removed link to full conference on JACoW now placed under "Conference"
#   v29.3	 26 Apr 2019 vrws			  - record <log_status code="FQ"> is now read and the corresponding timestamp is stored as "Paper accepted"
#   v29.4	 01 May 2019 vrws			  - problems with versions since spmsbatch-190315 (v20.0)  
#										  - to ease searching for starting page number in TeX files, the name of the paper is now placed after \setcounter{page}
#										  - for the generation of "proceed1.pdf" one pdfLaTeX run should be sufficient as there are no toc/tof/or else
#										  - correction of an error which was introduced in version 28.1 (2018-11-25) for ATC generation (\\fancyhead[CE,CO] had "\\small[CE,CO])" 
#											as text output with not closing brackets
#   v29.5	 15 May 2019 vrws			  - generation of REFDB file for inclusion of new datasets of conferences in "Reference Search Tool" 
#										  - # Latin Small Letter R with Caron [U+0159|&#345;]
#   v29.6    10 Jun 2019 vrws			  - a number of automatic conversions added

#   v29.7    10 Jul 2019 vrws			  - additional XMP records written with v29.1 of 03 Apr 2019 cause problems with CERN search engine.
#											after debugging with Ismael Posada Trobo <ismael.posada.trobo@cern.ch> the decision is to get back to pre v29.1 settings
#											and especially no XMP records introduced by the xmp package for AIIM and PDF/A with empty arguments ("[]"). For the time
#											being there is no solution for this as the CERN search engine will be phased out beginning 2020, meaning there isn't and
#											won't be any new development on it. A colleague of Ismael is developing the new CERN Search based on a technology totally
#											different, so they are completely focused on it. To deal with XMP in the current CERN Search, to install a new IFilter is
#                                           needed, configure it, and so on, so it can take months to make it work because it will require lot of testing. From the
#                                           technical and resources point of view, it's worth focusing in the new system and adapt this new one to this specific case.
#											So all XMP additions of v29.1 are commented out in the TeX file generation and it's tested for IPAC2019 
#   v29.8    16 Aug 2019 vrws             - TiO2, CH4, CO2
#                                         - Michaela found out that PDFs with embedded videos are not displayed by browser internal PDF viewers; therefore a test
#											is made about videos in PDF (function "check_video_in_talk") and a warning is displayed as hover element on the link.
#											The warning reads "This PDF contains x videos which might not run in browser mode - download PDF". 
#   v29.9    29 Aug 2019 vrws               &#305;   U+0131   (LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS i)
#   v30.0    30 Sep 2019 vrws			  - new line for authors who do not provide material for publication 
#											($no_material_mark = 1 and $no_material_text = "... no material provided ...")
#										  - page number box hidden for papers without paper
#										  - introduced "$" (end of string compare) for all PDF downloads ($wget_fullfilename) to prevent problems with files like ".pdf.pdf"
#   v30.1    28 Oct 2019 vrws             - "NoMat"	is inactive for now (until problems with oral/poster detection is solved)
#										  - JSON production for references/bibliography switch off again as the main function to be used for
#											an indexing database (-> Jan Chrin) is now solved by "ref.ipac19.org"
#                                         x problems detected in COOL2019 with accented character names in session display when author is a presenter
#											compared to other ways of displays:
#											* accented character names are shown in lists of author, keyword, classification, institutes, but the presenter mark is missing
#											* session shows the presenter mark but does not have accented characters
#										  - DOI format changed in RIS record: "DO  - doi:$citdoi" (lowercase doi, no space)
#										  - LaTeX export format changed (check edit mark: #') 
#                                         - BibTeX export format changed
#											* "booktitle" contains now only "Proc. conference"
#											* "month" now lowercase without "." (see change of $pub_month_abbr below)
#											* "publisher" has now {JACoW Publishing, Geneva, Switzerland} without "address"
#											* "issn" newly introduced 
#										  - Text/Word export now with font type setting for "Times New Roman" to ensure correct copy and
#											paste in Word
#										  - $pub_month_abbr (only used in BibTeX) definition changed to lowercase without "."
#										  - file name check: "^" and "$" introduced to make sure only correctly named files are downloaded
#   v30.2    06 Nov 2019 vrws             - again back to modification marked as #110217 in v12.9 of 14-17 Feb 2011 that TeX files to be 
#											compiled with LuaLaTeX are written with the encoding tag UTF-8, but the encoding of the TeX file 
#											has no encoding marked for writing
#	v31.0	 10 Nov 2019 vrws			  - problem with UTF-8 name handling, decoding SPMS names with UTF-8 bytes or HTML entities, or Windows-1252
#											strings, makes encoding too complicated. Therefore "names-utf.txt" changed to carry the JACoW Id as
#											entry for name transcoding. Now the SPMS name entry will not be used anymore but substituted by
#											the name in "modnames-utf.txt"
#										  - warning text for PDF videos run in browser 
#										  - new fields/changes for Kirsten Sachs
#										  - new output in HTML headers to identify JPSP script name and modification date 
#                                         - changed/additional data fields for INSPIRE (email with Kirsten Sachs)

#
#	v31.1	 10 Feb 2020 vrws			  - check of all changes of v 31.0 to find missing HighwirePress_Tags
#
#	v31.2	 Apr/May 2020 vrws			  # implementation of security features found using <webbkoll.dataskydd.net>
#											o Content Security Policy (CSP) header
#										  ~ currently removed as they conflicted with local (!!) script execution (hyphenation, xbt)
#										  - strings [ùúûÙÚÛ] and [üÜ] were missing there "[]" in helpsort_acc_chars
#										  - cite key for BibTeX/LaTeX may not include "'"
#
#	v31.3    16 Jun 2020 vrws			  - instdoi.htm wasn't displayed correctly due to wrong escaping of strings in "DHTM qq(<frameset rows"
#										  - "DC.issued" in DOI HTML record had »content="$meta_cit_date"« without »$«
#										  - "Ã£" -> ã added to helpsort_acc_chars"
#										  - removed "$utf8_mode" as it was set to "true" without alternate code
#
#   v31.4    30 Jun 2020 vrws             - reacting on the mail from "Artemis Lavasa <artemis.lavasa@cern.ch>" concerning the update
#											of DOI XML records from Datacite Metadata Schema 3.1 to the now required 4.3
#											First action was to just increment the kernel number "https://datacite.org/schema/kernel-3"
#											to "kernel-4". Further adaptions are needed (e.g. affiliation should be easy as long as
#											no ROR or ISNI is required; same for funding)
#
#   v31.5    23 Aug 2020 vrws   		  - &#65285;   U+FF05  % (Fullwidth Percent Sign)
#										  - LaTeX package "ulem" changed to "soul" as it allows hyphenation in underlined words;
#											in addition \uline has been changed to \ul for "soul"
#										  - removed duplicate "alt" in "b0nner.htm"
#										  - Cs2Te, CaF2 added
#
#  v31.6     30 Sep 2020 vrws             - missing strikethrough command (\sout) after switching from LaTeX package "ulem" to "soul"
#                                           changed "\sout{}" to "\st{}"
#										  - update of "http" to "https" for all currently used addresses (not historic or documented URLs nor
#                                           xsi resource like "xsi:schemaLocation", "xmlns", "xmlns:xsi")
#
#  v32.0     15 Oct 2020 vrws             - exporting abstract content to new directory /ABS for keyword search (Kazuro wants this for ICALEPCS),
#											this is an extend to the option of reading abstracts from files when missing.
#										  - directory setting for "abstract_insert" has been changed from "raw_paper_directory" to "abstract_directory"
#
#  v32.1     22 Oct 2020 vrws	          - new code for display of videos tested
#										  - new symbol/icon introduced for slides and videos
#                                         - separate download command file (videoget.bat) for talk videos (actually only mp4 enabled currently) 
#                                         - loading the package "ifluatex" throws errors in the "LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 1" version, 
#											therefore changed to "iftex"
#
#  v32.2     19 Nov 2020 vrws	          - Slide and Poster show wrong (paper_code[pap]) when upload to multiple codes is allowed in SPMS,
#											now only the primary papercode is checked and displayed (prg_code[pap][prg_code_p[pap]])
#
#  v32.3     10 Dec 2020 vrws             - comment for the remark on v29.0 15 Mar 2019: no idea why "UTF_convert_spec_chars" leaves out "&,>,<"
#											the procedure used in this routine (decode_entities) is defined this way (but the solution is 
#											exactly mimics this behaviour)
#											if the opposite is wanted "encode_entities" with filter for invalid characters should be used
#     									  - introduced the following Unicode CJK Symbols for web conversion (UTF8 byte representation)
#											these sy,bols were already introduced with v17.5 on 10. Aug 2013 for the LaTeX conversion
#	                                        o &#12310;/U+3016 LEFT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET 
#	                                        o &#12311;/U+3017 RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET
#     									  - changed \xc2\xbf from "Inverted question mark" to "Single quote" (was done already in LaTeX conversion (04.08.10))
#										  - major change is the restructuring of calls to the following procedures:
#											* convert_spec_chars_TXT
#											  -> UTF_convert_spec_chars
#												 -> convert_spec_chars
#												 -> UTF_supb
#												 -> decode_entities
#											* encode_entities ('<>&"') is only employed where material is written to XML files (Endnotes, INSPIRE)
#										  - addded missing XML header (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>) to all Endnote XML files (CITEXP)
#                                         - https://jacow.org/ changed to https://www.jacow.org/ to save one redirection 
#											(first conference with new setting is IBIC2020)
#										  - to prevent rejection bei datacite.org when DOI site contain a subdomain like "www." this string is therefore removed
#										  - the Endnotes record has 2 entries for <pages>; one with the page numbers, the other with the paper code
#										  ? is there no entry type for editor in Endnotes?
#										  - as safe measure, text string in BibTeX export are put in double curly braces to ensure correct capitalization
#
#  v32.4     05 Feb 2021 vrws             - extended "<conf_id>-refdb.csv" to contain DOI and PubStatus for inclusion in "refs.jacow.org"
#

#
#  author tag 
#		<citation_author> 
#				must contain the authors (and only the actual authors) of the paper. Don't use it for the author of the website or for
