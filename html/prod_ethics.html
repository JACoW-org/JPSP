<h1>Publishing Policies &amp; Ethics</h1>
<h2 class="fieldkey">Ethical Publication Practices</h2>
<p class="intro">JACoW is committed to the high standards of publishing integrity and academic honesty. 
 Authors, editors, and reviewers are encouraged to refer to "<a href="https://publicationethics.org/">The Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE)</a>"
 and to follow its guidelines.</p>

<h2 class="fieldkey">Ethical Publication Practices</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Authors are expected to pursue objectiveness and rigour in all aspects of their work.</li>
	<li>Authors are obligated to provide corrections of mistakes.</li>
	<li>The list of authors should accurately reflect those involved in the work.</li>
	<li>JACoW only considers work that has not been published in this form elsewhere.</li>
	<li>Authors, editors, and reviewers must disclose interests that might appear to affect their ability to present or review data objectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="fieldkey">Editorial Committee</h2>
<p class="intro">Reviewers of the proceedings (members of the organizing committee of JACoW events and other JACoW experts) are responsible for the editorial decisions and editorial processes. The procedures may vary between different conference series.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The reviewers of the proceedings are committed to ensuring the quality of the publication and 
		to ensuring that the reported information is ethical, accurate and relevant to the journal
		and conference series.</li>
	<li>They have full independence and are not dictated to or influenced by any factors (political, commercial, etc.).</li>
	<li>Their decision to accept or reject a paper for publication is based on the rules of the conference series, 
		merits of the work and the relevance to the journal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="fieldkey">Review</h2>
<p class="intro">All published articles are reviewed.</p>
<ul>
